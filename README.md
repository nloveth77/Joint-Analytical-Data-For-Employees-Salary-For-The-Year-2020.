Introduction:

Every employee expects a salary as a reward for his /her job and services. Hence, the reason for this analysis is to carefully understand the structure and standard of paying employees in various job titles.

Objectives:

This project is focused on analyzing the salaries of employees from different job titles for the year 2020. This analysis further aims at helping their current Employers, intending Employers and the Human Resource Managers to view employees current payment standard and also use the results from the analysis to improve employees salaries standard.

Methodology:

The major dataset used for this analysis is the Joint Employees Salary List for the year 2020. The key methodology used is Microsoft Excel and the Pivot table in Microsoft Excel was the major tool used to address and answer all of the project questions.

Story of Data:

The dataset is a public dataset available for public consumption. The dataset was downloaded from kaggle.com and it has a total number of 6699 rows and 6 columns.

The dataset is structured in columns and rows. The columns contain variables, both Dependent and Independent Variables. And the rows contain the data points and salaries.

The analysis includes Salary, Years of Experience, and Age as the key outcome variable and other variables such as Education Level, Job Title, and Gender. These variables basically contribute to this analysis as they are key factors to addressing and answering questions from the project. There were no limitations during the analysis as the data is already clean.

Data Splitting and Preprocessing:

-Data cleaning

I got the dataset downloaded from kaggle.com and uploaded it into my Excel Workbook for further analysis. Basic checks and observations were made in the dataset to ensure it was clean and consistent for analysis. Checks for duplicates, empty cells, inconsistencies in letter casing and spacing were made and corrected. To retain the raw dataset for another use, I had to duplicate the dataset and use one for the analysis.

Data Splitting:

The dataset was split into two variables namely, Dependent Variables and Independent Variables.

-Independent Variables

1. Gender

2. Education Level

3. Job Title

-Dependent Variables

In-analysis Observations and Recommendations:

-ANALYSIS- 6 Top Salary Earners;

1. The employees with the job title Data scientist earn higher salary than other salary earners within the dataset.

2. Among other salary earners, employees with these job titles Data Scientist Software Engineer Manager, Software Engineer, Senior Project Engineer, and Data Analyst Product.

Recommendations;

1. Seeing that the data scientist earns lots of money, the HR should ensure that they carry out their duties and services to the Organization effectively to boost revenue generation.

2. Supervisions on the above 6 job titles should be done too to ensure

they carry out their duties sincerely and effectively.

-ANALYSIS- 5 Top Job Titles;

1. Evaluating job titles by years of experience, it is noticed that software engineers have higher years of experience making their job title top among others .

2. The senior project engineer also requires high year of experience but has the least years of experience amongst the other top job titles.

Recommendations;

1. Software engineers should be given some sort of bonuses seeing they play a vital and major role in the Organization setting with their outstanding years of experience.

2. The senior project engineers also add lots of values and improvements to the organization with their productive years of experience, so more projects and opportunities can be given to them to increase their experience because they have the potential do more with their job title.

1. I observed that the men gender is the highest salary earners with the sum salary of $445,643,606 from this dataset.

2. The women gender also earned satisfying salaries, because they were limited to certain job titles.

Recommendations;

1. Since the men are doing so well in their job titles, their salaries should not be delayed or tampered with as it will encourage them to do more with their job titles.

2. Some job titles shouldn’t only be open for men alone, the women gender also doing exploits in all career types and have great potentials to stand out as top earners.

2. The youngest lads that receive high salary from the analysis are of 27 years old.

Recommendations;

1. The analysis shows that most job titles don’t employ very young people because of their low/short years of experience hence the reason there are no much young employees with high salaries.

2. Having reached this height of excellence at 27 in their job titles, these lads should given more opportunities and chances to strive more and add more value to the organization.

-ANALYSIS- Job Titles With High Years of Experience;

1. Observation through the dataset shows that the software engineers has the highest years of experience.

2. Observation also shows that the senior project engineers has the least years of experience among the five highest years of experience.

Recommendations;

1. Seeing that this job title has high years of experience, the HR should ensure that the services and duties of these software engineers are up to standard and productive.

2. The senior project engineer still has great potentials to do better for the organization in the coming years.

Post-Analysis Observations and Recommendations:

Observations;

1. Most of the data scientists are men and the youngest lads among them are within the ages of 29–30.This job title stands out as the highest salary earners for the year 2020 and they are mostly holders of Master’s, Master’s Degree and PhD with good years of experience.

These employees have gathered a lot of years of experience and their highest education level are holders of Master’s Degree and Bachelor’s Degree.

3. Most PhD holders are male and just a few female. Job titles like Data Scientist, Software engineer manager, Senior project engineer and Research director have lots of PhD holders and the data scientists among them earned highly. The youngest PhD holder is of age 34. They all have a good number of experience in their different job titles.

4. The job title with the highest years of experience are the software engineers and they are mostly dominated by women and their education level is PhD, they also earn high salaries. The youngest high earner among them earns €377,302.

5. Employees with the highest salaries are holders of PhD, bachelor’s and bachelor’s degrees and they are mostly men in the categories of CEOS, Financial managers and Chief technology officer with years of experience.

Recommendations;

1. I recommend that organizations open/give opportunities to the female gender to harness the data scientist job title . Young lads with this job title with little or no experience should be given platforms to harness this career field because they have the capacity to grow organizations with their amazing data skills and in return generate more revenues for the Organization.

2. The product managers can further their education level, build more years of experience on the job so they can help the business generate more revenues and also boost their salaries. More female gender should be encouraged to walk through this career/job path.

3. The female gender should be encouraged to further their education level. Other job titles can optimize their education level requirement so as to motivate employees with low education to strive towards attaining higher education level and experience.

4. The software engineer managers can cut down their designated years of experience so that young people can join the career path and also learn on their job. More of me should also be encouraged to join the job.

5. Most job titles and salaries shouldn’t be based on high education level alone, rooms should be given to well-skilled and ready-to-learn employees who want to build on their careers and at the same time add value to the organizations.

Conclusion:

This analysis has been able to answer relevant questions from the Joint Employees Salary Data For the Year 2020. And by this analysis, the major stakeholders can make and act on insightful data-driven business decisions on employees salaries that will also motivate and encourage employees to improve their productivity.
